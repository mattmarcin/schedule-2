```
I want to prototype a web game using ThreeJS. It will be a first person game. How should we set this up with Vite? For starters I to be able to run around in a FPS view on flat ground on a sunny day.
```

```
Lets use typescript. Basic flat ground with a skybox and FPS controls.
```

```
Yes, the plan looks good, but don't save it to a file. Let's switch to Code mode to implement it.
```

```
I should be able to walk around. Add streets and a few houses to the world.
```

```
Vite is already running. Now add openable doors to the houses and an interior with a bed and night stand. Add dashed lines to the road.
```

```
The door opens, but there is no doorway. Also there is Zfighting with the floor of the house and the ground. Give the house floor a bit of thickness to fix that. Add a doorknob to the doors in a different color (black) and show a "Click to Open" billboard at the doorknob when the player is close and looking at the door.
```

```
This change made the house transparent which is not intended. The house should not be transparent. What I want is for there to be a door opening behind where the door is so that the player can walk into the door. Also make the billboard 3x smaller.
```

```
Inside each house, add 3, empty circular planter pots. Make sure the pots are a seperate code file so that we can exapnd the functionality.

Also, create a reusable object for the itneract billboard text module.

Finally, add a basic inventory to the player. TO depict the inventory will be a horizontal line of empty square icons along the bottom of the screen. 5 total.
```

```
In item slot 1, add a bag of soil. The icon for this will be at /public/icons/soil.png

When I press the 1 key, the slot in the inventory bar should highlight and I should have what looks like a bag of soil in my hands.
```

```
When the player is holding the bag of soil and aims at a Pot. A billboard that says (E): Add Soil should appear.

If the player hits the E key, add soil to the pot they are looking at that fills it up. Visually this should look like a different shade of brown filled to 80% of the height of the pot.
```

```
The watering can needs to be oreitened 90 degrees to the left. Its is not properly aligned.

When the player is holding the watering can and views a Pot that has soil in it, the billboard should say (E) Water Soil.

Upon hitting E, the dirt should turn a darker shade to indicate it is watered.
```

```
If the soil has been watered and the user has the Vial out (3) the billboard should say (E) Add Seed. Upon hitting E, add a green seed to the top of the soil in the pot.
```

```
Once the seed has been planted there should be a billboard progress bar below it that ticks every 60 and reaches 100% at 60 seconds.

After 5 seconds, the plant should have 1 leaf. At 60 seconds the plant should have 5 leaves with a stalk in the middle.

The interaction bilboard should now say (E) Harvest

When harvested, the Pot should reset back to empty and slot 4 of the inventory will get a Baggie item (icon: baggie.png). This icon will also should a count for how many have been collected. No max amount.
```

```
When I harvest a grown plant, I am not getting the Baggie added to the inventory bar.

When I click E to ahrvest a grown plant, I am still not getting the baggie icon (with a quanitity number) public/icons/baggie.png
```

```
When I click E to ahrvest a grown plant, I am still not getting the baggie icon (with a quanitity number) public/icons/baggie.png

Also, shorten the grown time to 20 seconds.
```

```
InventoryManager.ts:122 Cannot add count to slot 3 as it has no item icon defined.
addItemCount    @   InventoryManager.ts:122
Game.ts:290 Harvested plant via E key
ControlsManager.ts:29 Pointer unlocked

here is the error
```

```
The baggie icon should be hidden in inventory slot 4 if the count is 0.
```

```
If I have actived the Baggie item (slot 4) and have atleast 1 in my hand. The NPCs should have a (E) Sell Baggie) billboard.

When I hit E, decrement my total number of baggies, turn the white part of their eyes to light red and add some smoke particle effects from the top of their head.
```

```
Add 3 NPC characters that hang out on the street. They should have a cartoonish shape and their face should have large bulbous eyes with black pupils. Use primitives to assemble their bodies.
```

```
Make the smoke start at the top of their head and make it last 3 times longer. Keep their eyes red for 10 seconds before reseting them.

From now on, add my prompts to 'README.md' (see below for file content)  So that we have a history of how I built this.
```

```
Add a 5th item to the inventory bar for Cash.

The icon is cash.png. Increment it by 50 every time we sell a baggie.

Add some particle effects of cash flying out of the NPC toward the player when you sell a baggie.

When we sell a baggie, play the sound: /audio/sold1.mp3 and then play /audio/ca-ching.mp3
